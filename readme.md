Hello guys! So people are freakign out because they don't know how to use Composer and they've been getting error and such and so.

>That's why I made this. This has everything you need to get Laravel 4 started without doing those initial things like installing and such.

>> If you're really itching to start bashing away at your keyboard and explore laravel then this is for you.

>People have been wondering about the size of Laravel 4 right now, 17Mb like what dafuq!? well don't stress coz it won't be loaded every request you get. You'll have to wait a little more while uploading but it's all worth it.

Last thing:
> I placed here the htaccess files I use for free web hosts that cant be configured. The "root" file redirects the user to the public folder then the "public" file redirects the user to the "index.php".

>>So instead of having "yourwebsite.com/public/index.php" you can just have "yourwebsite.com".

>>Aint that neat!
So I commented out the vendor folders and such in the gitignore file so I can upload them but you can uncomment them later :)



## Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
